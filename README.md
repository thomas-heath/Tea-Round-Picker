# Tea Round Picker

As part of the interview process for Nisien.ai, I've been tasked with creating a Tea Round Picker!
This project will take Users and Drink orders as input, and then provide the user with a designated drink maker, solving all arguments over such matters.

I've built it using Vite, it's using React and TypeScript.
