# Tea Round Picker

As part of the interview process for Nisien.ai, I've been tasked with creating a Tea Round Picker!
This project will take Users and Drink orders as input, and then provide the user with a designated drink maker, solving all arguments over such matters.

I've built the front-end using Vite, it's using React and TypeScript.
I've built the back-end using .NET 8.

To build and run the front-end, assuming you have npm installed, open ./Front-end in a terminal use the command `npm run dev`. Out of the box it's configured to point at an API on a port that's used by an included Docker Compose file, you can run this from the same folder using the command `docker compose up`.

The back-end should be easy enough to run using Visual Studio, Rider or VSCode.
